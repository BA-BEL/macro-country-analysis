Macroeconomic Analysis of Argentina

The results found that a combination of diminished aggregate supply and unrestricted aggregate demand caused a decline in output but a substantial rise in inflation. The analysis concludes with a policy recommendation of improved and consistent contractionary fiscal policies.
